# 🚨 SECURITY ALERT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Issue Discovered
The `.env` file containing sensitive credentials was accidentally tracked in git and pushed to the repository. This file contains:
- Database connection URL with username/password
- Health dashboard password

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. 🔄 Change Database Password IMMEDIATELY
- Log into your Neon database dashboard
- Change/rotate the database password 
- Update your local `.env` file with the new credentials
- **DO NOT commit the new .env file**

### 2. 🗑️ Clean Git History
The `.env` file is in git history (commit 9a5036c). To completely remove it:

```bash
# Install git-filter-repo (more reliable than filter-branch)
pip install git-filter-repo

# Remove .env from entire git history
git filter-repo --path .env --invert-paths

# Force push to update remote (WARNING: This rewrites history)
git push origin --force --all
```

### 3. 📝 Set Up Environment Variables Properly

Create a new `.env` file (it's now gitignored):
```bash
# Copy the template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your NEW credentials
nano .env
```

**Required variables:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://new_username:new_password@host:5432/database
HEALTH_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

### 4. 🔒 For Production/Vercel
- Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard (Settings → Environment Variables)
- Use the NEW database credentials
- Set a STRONG health dashboard password
- Never include actual credentials in code

## Prevention
- ✅ `.env` is now in `.gitignore`
- ✅ All sensitive data should be in environment variables only
- ✅ Use `.env.example` for documenting required variables

## Current Status
- [x] `.env` removed from future commits
- [x] `.gitignore` updated
- [ ] **YOU MUST: Change database password**
- [ ] **YOU MUST: Clean git history** 
- [ ] **YOU MUST: Update production environment variables**
